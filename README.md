# HEX_40106_Video_Synth
A CHA/V based video synth

This is my take on the Jonas Bers' CHA/V video synth (https://jonasbers.com/chav/).

NOTE: In the prototype I show in the pics, the labels "sync" and "out" of the jacks are swapped. This mistake has been corrected in the Gerber file uploaded (Gerber_PCB_OSC BANK 40106 HEX-VIDEO SYNTHvs3).
