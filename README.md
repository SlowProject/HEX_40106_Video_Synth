# HEX_40106_Video_Synth
A CHA/V based video synth

This is my take on the Jonas Bers' CHA/V video synth (https://jonasbers.com/chav/).
Here I am using this type of VGA test signal generator (https://es.aliexpress.com/item/33056599680.html).
The VGA test signal generator is cyanoacrylate-glued to the PCB after doing the corresponding wire connections (see pics).

NOTE: In the prototype I show in the pics, the labels "sync" and "out" of the jacks are swapped. This mistake has been corrected in the Gerber file uploaded (Gerber_PCB_OSC BANK 40106 HEX-VIDEO SYNTHvs3).
